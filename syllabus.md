## Grading


Grading will be based on:
- in class work (quizzes, 'exit tickets')
- 2 mid term exams 
- final exam: Wednesday May 15


**Grading scale:** 
(Taken from a syllabus by Prof. James Thomas)

**A** demonstrates **excellent** understanding and ability to explain the course material

**B** demonstrates **good** understanding and ability to explain the course material

**C** demonstrates **moderate** understanding and ability to explain the course material

**D** demonstrates **little** understanding and ability to explain the course material


**F** demonstrates **very little to no** understanding and ability to explain the course material

**Participation**
You are responsible for your own learning. I think you will learn best if you attend all classes, otherwise it is easy to fall behind quickly.

# Schedule

(tentative, will be completed later)

An excerpt of an older edition (7th edition) that I will annotate during class is here:
https://notability.com/n/1h0PgqVQlEqfEbeqDJnhDv

**Before** each class,
1. either **read the section of the text** listed for that day, OR **watch the videos of the corresponding sections** in this playlist by Kimberly Brehm
https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-gb0E4MII28GykmtuBXNUNoej-vY5Rz&si=8ks94rGyBEZ8Io45

2. then try the homework (and check your answers in the back of the text). During class we will go over the homework problems.
3. 'Exit ticket' for each class will be a few problems similar to the homework problems - you do these in class and submit them before you leave.

## Academic Integrity

Do not copy and submit answers you do not understand and can't explain. I reserve the right to meet with you and ask you to explain your answers, and may give you an F for the assignment or course if you cannot reasonably explain an answer. In other words, don't turn in things just to turn in things.

I am **happy to give you the answer to any question** in the textbook, and the textbook itself has solutions to odd numbered problems. But you are cheating yourself if you just copy them, and you are **missing the point of the course** if you do so. **The point of the course is to learn to THINK, not to parrot information!**

The college's policy on academic integrity also applies to this course
https://www.oldwestbury.edu/policies/academicresearch/policy-academic-integrity
Here are some excerpts from that policy:

>As members of the Old Westbury community, students are expected to adhere to standards of honesty and ethical behavior. Plagiarism and other types of academic dishonesty are condemned at all academic institutions. These acts detract from the student’s intellectual and personal growth by undermining the processes of higher learning and the struggle with one’s own expression of ideas and information.  Good academic procedure requires giving proper credit when using the words or ideas of others.

>Plagiarizing means “presenting somebody else’s words or ideas without acknowledging where those words and ideas come from” (Ann Raimes, Keys for Writers, 7th ed., p.135).  Examples include:
>-   copying material from the Internet or other sources and presenting it as one’s own
>-    using any author’s words without quotation marks; using any quotation without credit
>-   changing any author's words slightly and presenting them as one's own
>-   turning in any assignment containing material written by someone else (including tutor or friend); buying work and submitting it as one's own

>  Know what plagiarism is and how to avoid it; for guidance see Raimes or any other college writing handbook. 


### Course Policy on Usage of AI Chatbots or Codelike ChatGPT, Bard, Bing, GitHub Copilot, etc. 

AI Chatbots can be helpful in learning topics, however, at the moment, by and large they tend to struggle with math because they are parroting words without any reasoning.

**AI Chatbots sometimes give inaccurate, incomplete, outdated, or outright false responses in an *extremely confident* tone, so use with caution and DO NOT BLINDLY TRUST THEM!** 


That being said, I allow their use in a limited and appropriate way - namely as a tool to help you learn. However they can also be used as a tool to avoid learning, to avoid engaging with the material, etc., and you are cheating yourself if you use tools this way. 

Here are some appropriate ways to use them:
-  if you can't resolve an error message, you can try asking an AI Chatbot to explain it
- You can ask it to test your understanding of course material: e.g. ask it to make up quiz questions on concepts you just learned
- Ask it to explain something 


**For this course, you must understand and be able to explain (at an appropriate level) any answers you submit, whether your answer is your own or you get it from classmate, internet, textbook, AI chatbots, etc.** 


## Accommodations for students with disabilities 

  
 If you have or suspect you may have a physical, psychological, medical or learning disability that may impact your course work, please contact Stacey DeFelice, Director, The Office of Services for Students with Disabilities (OSSD), NAB 2065, Phone: 516-628-5666, Email: defelices@oldwestbury.edu. The office will help you determine if you qualify for accommodations and assist you with the process of accessing them. All support services are free and all contacts with the OSSD are strictly confidential. SUNY Old Westbury is committed to assuring that all students have equal access to all learning activities and to social activities on campus.

## Title IX, Sexual discrimination, harassment, and violence
  

SUNY Old Westbury prohibits sexual discrimination, harassment and violence, and will promptly respond to all complaints.  The purpose of Title IX is to prevent sex discrimination on campus, address reported assaults and incidents, limit the effects of harassment on the educational environment, and prevent its recurrence.  If you or someone you know believes they have been subjected to sexual discrimination, harassment or violence, help is available. To report or for more information please visit https://www.oldwestbury.edu/title-ix, please contact the Title IX coordinator, Deputy Title IX coordinator or University Police at 516-876-3333.
